Roller Derby Journal is an app that I am currently developing. It is meant to be a platform where a player can track their progress, write notes and save events to improve their skills and planning. 
It is build with React, Typescript, a node.js server, an SQL Database, and other tools like Tailwind CSS or Zod. 
I am developing this project from the very beginning, starting with the prototyping and design fase on Figma. As you can see below, I am planning the user flows and building each component.
